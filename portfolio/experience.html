            <li><small> I worked in construction for about 4 years. 
                <br>I specifically did framing construction. I learned 
                <br> to appreciate everything I have, since I worked outside
                <br> through every season.

            <li><small> Other than that, I've worked at Amazon since 2021. 
                <br> The benefits are really good, and right now I'm on
                <br> flex shift, which is helping.
