    <p>LANGLEY, VA-- A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly 
  obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

  <p>According to the report, sections of the documents"&mdash;"almost invariably the most crucial passages"&mdash;"are marred by an indelible black 
    ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
  </p>

   
<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss </b>lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ol>
